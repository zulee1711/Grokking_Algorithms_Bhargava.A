'''
What it does:
* take a list of variable in and check if there is a duplicated var
* If there exist such var, it will rename the var by adding a number to the end of var's name
Downsize:
* It will return a list of variable and need to be added back to the dataframe if necessary. This will need to be process through another function and might lost its original position in the dataframe
