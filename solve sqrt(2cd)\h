# Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:
'''Q = Square root of [(2 * C * D)/H]
Following are the fixed values of C and H:
C is 50. H is 30.
D is the variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.'''

import math
c = 50
h = 30
x = []
d = [i for i in input().split(',')]
for i in d:
    x.append(str(int(round(math.sqrt(2*c*float(i)/h)))))
print((',').join(x))
